Please note:
The api server is hosted at http://localhost:3000/students

#To setup the mock api server on localhost, open gitbash and follow the commands :
In the project directory, go to folder named 'server'
npm install json-server
json-server --watch db.json



## Development server
Run 'npm install'
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
