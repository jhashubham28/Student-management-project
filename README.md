# Student Management using Angular and Mock APIs

Please note:
The api server is hosted at http://localhost:3000/students

#To setup the mock api server on localhost, open gitbash and follow the commands :
In the project directory, create a folder named 'server'
cd server
npm init
npm install json-server
json-server --watch db.json



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
